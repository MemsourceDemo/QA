              <br>

              Due to the global health crisis created by the spread of Covid-19, we just wanted to remind you of the following:
              <br>
              1. All interactions facilitated by the Meero Platform are between independent parties. That means that everybody is responsible for themselves.
              <br>
              2. You should take the precautionary measures detailed in our <a href="https://help.meero.com/en/articles/4001969-meero-best-practices" target="_blank">Help Center</a>, and use your best judgment.
              <br>
              3. You should also be familiar with all restrictions in your area, as restrictions may be different in each location.
              <br>
              4. Please note that neither Meero nor the client will be liable in the event that you become ill following a shoot or if any local restriction has been violated.
              <br>
              5. You’re free to accept or reject as many shoots as you like - but you should never accept a shoot if you feel unwell.
            info1: 'By accepting this shoot proposal, you agree to the terms of the shoot proposal and to follow <a href=''http://help.meero.com/en/articles/4001969-meero-best-practices'' target=''_blank''>Meero Best Practices</a> during your performance of the shoot.'
            info2: 'Please note that in light of the constantly-evolving situation created by Covid-19, last-minute cancellation fees for cancellations related to Covid-19 are suspended until further notice.'

          answer_1: 'It is essential to inform your work area, so that we can propose shoots to you. Please consider that you can change your work area as you see fit on your agenda.'
          answer_10: 'You must use at least 3 exposures (-3.0, + 3). The algorithm also accepts a bracketing with 4 exposures (-4, -2.0, + 2). However, you must keep a constant number of exposures during a shoot.'
          answer_11: 'If you are using a full frame, you must use a lens like Canon 16-35 mm or 17-40 mm (or a Nikon or Tamron or any other equivalent). If you are using an APS-C, you must use a wide angle lens like Canon 12-24 mm, 10-22 mm or 10-18 (or a Nikon or Tamron or any other equivalent). The fisheye lenses are not listed among the accepted lenses for Meero''s services.'
          answer_12: 'Yes'
          answer_13: 'Yes, unless there is special request from the customer. In order to deliver the correct shoot, please carefully read the customer''s guidelines, which you can find on your Meero account.'
          answer_14: 'No, in this case you have to take one-shot or burst shots if there is movement.'
          answer_15: 'No, it is not an exclusive contract. You are free to work with whoever you want.'
          answer_16: 'No. As stated in the contract, you may not propose, solicit and/or perform assignments with Meero''s customers other than through Meero for the duration of this Agreement and for six months after the termination of this Agreement. In addition, you may not seek to contact a customer for the same purpose without the intermediation of Meero. Finally, you can not propose a payment of the price of your services, of that of Meero''s or a supplement of the price directly to the customer outside this contract.'
          answer_17: 'No, as indicated in the contract, you cannot sell nor exploit neither the raw nor the edited images. Nevertheless, you can use the images for your Meero book on your personal space.'
          answer_18: 'You will receive payments twice a month: once for all shoots made from the 1st to the 15th of the month (payment made on the 19th of the month), and a second time for all shoots made from the 16th to the end of the month (payment made on the 4th of the following month).'
          answer_19: 'Travel-related benefits are not applicable for public transportation. For journeys exceeding 20 km, a kilometer supplement of € 0.20 per kilometer will be applied (€ 12 for a 100 km return trip, for example).'
          answer_2: 'Please always add all your unavailability dates in order to receive all new requests for shoots. Please consider that our search algorithm takes into account your unavailability and your work area to ensure that the result is as relevant as possible for our customers and yourself as well. We recommend to all photographers to always keep up-to-date the availability calendar for at least a period of 3 weeks.'
          answer_20: 'On your personal space, you can find all your past and current invoices. The list of current invoices is a summary of the shoots for the last 15 days. On the 15th and 31st of the month, this work in progress will automatically be billed and the amount displayed will be transferred to your payment account. If you wish, you can change the number on the Meero invoices to match your accounting method.'
          answer_21: 'We put at your disposal a set of documents (videos, pdf...) to discover new ways of doing shoots. The goal is to make you feel at ease with any shoot and boost efficiency.'
          answer_22: 'No, this information is totally free for all photographers onboarded by Meero.'
          answer_3: 'You will receive an SMS and an e-mail to inform you that a shoot in your work area is available and that your agenda is free at this time. You can accept or reject the shoot independently. Please remember to fill in your calendar in order to receive notifications for new shoots!'
          answer_4: 'You can unbook directly through your personal space. Click on the desired future shoot and then on "Cancel" and confirm your action.'
          answer_5: 'Of course you can refuse a shoot! Please consider that If you cancel too frequently, though, this will be reflected in your profile and taken into account by the matching algorithm that assigns customers to photographers. We do have all our trust in the fact that you will honour your commitments. '
          answer_6: 'Requirements of the general guidelines apply, but please also note that some customers have added specific guidelines for their business. Please take the time to read these specific guidelines and connect with us if you have any questions.'
          answer_7: 'When there are no specific requests, please send your photos in the format: JPEG Medium for bracketing for Real Estate shoots. For outdoor shoots, please use RAW format without bracketing. Please note that specific settings may be required: please refer to the Guidelines that you received at the moment of accepting the shoot. Do not hesitate to contact the Photography Team, should you have any questions.'
          answer_8: 'Please send the photos in 300 DPI.'
          answer_9: 'No, you must not rename files or change their size or format before sending them. In addition, please do not put your name, brand or logo on the photographs and videos.'

              reminder_p10: 'On the contrary, if you have to shoot a very small property, don''t hesitate to shoot every room from all angles and take closer shots on interesting elements.'
              reminder_p11: 'If a client asks you to stop shoot and you don''t have enough photos, tell him/her that you have to finish shoot and take additional photos, while staying polite of course ;)'
              reminder_p12: 'If we receive too many medias, we will need to do an arbitrary selection'
              reminder_p13: 'The golden rule is to remain faithful to the classic formats: 3:2 (horizontal) or 2:3 (vertical).'
              reminder_p14: 'Internet connections may take a lot of time for the photos to be uploaded. Our partners often encounter difficulties depending on the type of connection they use. We recommend that you get ahead of time and transfer the photos as soon as possible, so that we can deliver the images to the client on time.'
              reminder_p15: 'If a real-estate agency ask you to recover keys in its office to access a property, you should refuse. They have to go on-site, you should not be alone in a property. However, if a client explicitly asks you that, you have to call us so that we can settle this directly with him/her.'
              reminder_p16: 'An access problem with the shoot section? A special request from a live client? We are here to help if you have any doubts or glitches!'
              reminder_p17: 'If you would like to bring a particular detail to the post-production teams’ attention, do not hesitate to leave a comment when uploading the images.'
              reminder_p18: ' '
              reminder_p2: 'If we see recurring stains on the media you are sending, we would be forced to call on another service provider.'

              reminder_p21: 'Format specifications (horizontal or vertical) are always indicated in the guidelines.'
              reminder_p3: 'Clients give us very specific instructions about the source of light they prefer. They are always indicated on the guidelines. If they are not respected, the client will ask us to go back and do the shoot a second time.'
              reminder_p4: 'If you have any doubts, please do not hesitate to contact us.'
              reminder_p5: 'If you shoot with an artificial light, you have to <strong>set your white-balance</strong>. If presets are not satisfying enough, the best solution is to do a customised setting using a <strong>neutral grey chart</strong>, or, failing that, a white element of the place where you shoot. This operation should be repeated as the lighting ambience changes along the shoot :)'
              reminder_p6: 'Compliance with the guidelines is the most important aspect of your work in order to meet the client’s specifications. Please read them carefully to make sure everything is clear. If it’s not clear, don’t hesitate to contact us.'
              reminder_p7: 'You know how long it takes to sort images. To make the task as efficient as possible, make sure you don’t shoot no more or less than the quantity requested. If you like to make several shots to get the right one, help us by sorting out the pictures delivered ;)'
              reminder_p8: 'Don''t over-deliver! For instance, for a 12 photos real-estate shoot, we need to receive 20 photos maximum.'
              reminder_p9: 'In case the property is  very large, we recommend to take pictures of the main rooms (kitchen, living room, main bedroom and bathroom +a secondary one, and any special points of interest).'
