4God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 
5God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning-the first day. 
6And God said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water." 
7So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so. 
8God called the expanse "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning-the second day. 
9And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so.
